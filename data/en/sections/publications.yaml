- title: Communication Mechanisms and Prediction of Internet Rumors under the Background of Micro-spread

  paper:
    summary: Building on infectious disease propagation model, this paper establishes the node state transformation rules that reflect real-world rumor dynamics. A new state “susceptible and temporarily immune” is introduced to construct an enhanced rumor propagation model. Based on this framework, an empirical analysis is conducted, and a cluster search algorithm is applied to optimize the model's performance.
